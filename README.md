# Technical Documentation

## Project Overview
This project implements the complete fullstack solution as specified in the provided assessment PDF.  
It includes the **fallback scheduling algorithms** (utilization-based and heuristic hybrid approaches) and is fully integrated across the backend simulation engine and frontend interface.

The project follows **standard engineering best practices**, with code quality, modular architecture, logging, error handling, and structured state updates cleanly separated between client and server.
